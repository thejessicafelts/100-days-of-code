# 100 Days of Code
### 100 Projects that can be completed in one day or less

#### The Original -
The “official” version of this challenge is to spend at least an hour per days coding, for 100 days in a row; and to post about your progress on places like Twitter and GitHub. The idea is to motivate yourself to practice, to actually sit down and do the work. The best way to learn how to program is by programming, so this is the perfect way for novices (and non-novices!) to improve their coding.

#### The Remix -
While I fully believe this is the best way to partake in this challenge, this year, I'll be doing something a little different. Since I am also participating in **Year of Commits** - where I will push at least one commit per day to my GitHub profile, I will instead focus my **100 Days of Code** challenge on producing fully completed mini-projects that take me less than a day to complete. Because of this, projects may not come out on a daily basis - but my goal is to publish 100 of them, before years end.

#### The Projects -
Below I will list each of my projects, as I publish them. This will be updated as new content is created, so check back often, or [follow me on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/thejessicafelts) for updates.

**1.** To Be Determined
