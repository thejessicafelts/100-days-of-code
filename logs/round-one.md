## Day 002
###### January 09, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Professional Work from a Long-Term Contract Client
+ WordPress Theme Development

**Today's Progress**: There isn't a lot I can talk about with my work today. The bulk of my development today will be billable work for a long-term contract client, with the remainder being work on the WordPress theme (and possibly a plugin?) for [my website](http://www.thejessicafelts.com). Obviously I'm still using the Twenty Sixteen theme from WordPress. That will be changing soon.

I'm also going to be working on a separate WordPress project as well, if time allows. Again, another project I can't really talk much about, but something I hope to share more broadly sooner than later.

**Thoughts:** It can be really hard to find inspiration for projects, when you don't have a lot of time to sit down and look around for it. I always thought I was a decent designer - and when it comes to designing for other people, I am; but when it comes to designing for myself, I am just at a loss. What do I want? What do I need? I would make a horrible client. My main thought for today is that it's hard to start developing something, without any idea what you want the end result to look like. #TheStruggleIsReal

## Day 001
###### January 08, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Markdown (.md) files; specifically in relation to their use on GitHub
+ WordPress Theme Development

**Today's Progress**: I have been working on getting this log setup for a good chunk of this morning. I may fork [Adam Pritchard's Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) so that I can use it for future reference. I have always had trouble remembering the finer points of markdown formatting. _**Goal:** A goal this year is to become better aquatinted with markdown, and to be able to write it more confidently._

After finishing this log, I will begin working on the first stages of development for a new WordPress theme. I relaunched [my blog](http://www.thejessicafelts.com) last night, and while the default _Twenty Sixteen_ theme is nice for starting out, my inner developer needs something fully custom, to be truly happy.

**Thoughts:** I really think I have under estimated the importance of keeping a log like this for the #100DaysOfCode challenge. As I've stated in the main [README.md](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/100-days-of-code/blob/master/README.md) file for this repo, I already tend to spend what this challenge would consider an _adequate_ amount of time coding every day, but to sit down and reflect in a log like this could prove to be very helpful and insightful.
