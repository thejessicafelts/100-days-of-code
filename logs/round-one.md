## Day 003
###### January 10, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Professional Work from a Long-Term Contract Client
+ [Github Pages](http://thejessicafelts.github.io) "Version 2.0" Development
+ WordPress Theme Development

**Today's Progress**: Aside from "work" work, and dabbling with WordPress theme development, like I've been doing daily, today I'm also going to be working on updating my GitHub Pages website. I use my GitHub Pages site as a portfolio of sorts, where I can keep a gallery, or list, of projects, with links and demos for people to view. Currently, the site is nothing more than an incomplete list of some projects I've taken on. I also include a biography, and a contact link. Nothing spectacular. Now, I've had to resort to using this site as a main portfolio for myself, as I had taken down my main website - assuming I'd relaunch it much sooner than has happened. So, while I'm still working on relaunching that site, I decided a good use of my Personal Development time would be to redesign how the GitHub Pages site looks and feels, make it more professional, and just make it more complete.

Today, I'm going to be working on playing around with showing and hiding divs with javascript. Just writing that out feels weird, because this is something I have known how to do for a long time, but for my GitHub Pages site, I would like to be able to assign different data-* attributes to each project I feature, and then be able to show or hide projects based on if the user selects to see them. Basically, I want to be able to filter projects by project type, year, or completion. The only way I can think to do this (that will be accepted by GitHub Pages) is with JavaScript, so today I'm going to play around, and see if I can get that to work.

**Thoughts:** Over the last two days, I've had to really think about how I want to develop this GitHub Pages site, to allow for the filtering that I want the site to have. I have considered using classes for each of the project divs, but I think that I can accomplish the same effect by using data-* attributes - something I have very little experience in using. GitHub Pages is a great service, and anyone who has a GitHub account, should definitely put together a GitHub Pages site with a list of projects - but working around its limitations has proven challenging for me (again, in respect to my wanting to filter things). It's challenging in a good way though, and I'm hoping to work through it, with a good outcome.

## Day 002
###### January 09, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Professional Work from a Long-Term Contract Client
+ WordPress Theme Development

**Today's Progress**: There isn't a lot I can talk about with my work today. The bulk of my development today will be billable work for a long-term contract client, with the remainder being work on the WordPress theme (and possibly a plugin?) for [my website](http://www.thejessicafelts.com). Obviously I'm still using the Twenty Sixteen theme from WordPress. That will be changing soon.

I'm also going to be working on a separate WordPress project as well, if time allows. Again, another project I can't really talk much about, but something I hope to share more broadly sooner than later.

**Thoughts:** It can be really hard to find inspiration for projects, when you don't have a lot of time to sit down and look around for it. I always thought I was a decent designer - and when it comes to designing for other people, I am; but when it comes to designing for myself, I am just at a loss. What do I want? What do I need? I would make a horrible client. My main thought for today is that it's hard to start developing something, without any idea what you want the end result to look like. #TheStruggleIsReal

## Day 001
###### January 08, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Markdown (.md) files; specifically in relation to their use on GitHub
+ WordPress Theme Development

**Today's Progress**: I have been working on getting this log setup for a good chunk of this morning. I may fork [Adam Pritchard's Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) so that I can use it for future reference. I have always had trouble remembering the finer points of markdown formatting. _**Goal:** A goal this year is to become better aquatinted with markdown, and to be able to write it more confidently._

After finishing this log, I will begin working on the first stages of development for a new WordPress theme. I relaunched [my blog](http://www.thejessicafelts.com) last night, and while the default _Twenty Sixteen_ theme is nice for starting out, my inner developer needs something fully custom, to be truly happy.

**Thoughts:** I really think I have under estimated the importance of keeping a log like this for the #100DaysOfCode challenge. As I've stated in the main [README.md](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/100-days-of-code/blob/master/README.md) file for this repo, I already tend to spend what this challenge would consider an _adequate_ amount of time coding every day, but to sit down and reflect in a log like this could prove to be very helpful and insightful.
