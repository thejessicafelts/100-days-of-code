## Day 020
###### January 28, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Private Client Work
+ Setting up JIRA for personal projects
+ [WordPress Theme Development](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/thejessicafelts_theme)

**Today's Progress:** Today consisted of a lot of private client work, and very little work on my own personal site. One thing I did accomplish for the personal site, however, is setting up a cloud-hosted JIRA account so I am able to open tickets and track progress like I would in any normal project.

**Thoughts:** None for today :-)

###### January 25, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ [WordPress Theme Development](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/thejessicafelts_theme)

**Today's Progress:** Today, I continued work on my personal site, working specifically on the #100DaysOfCode log section of the site. I adjusted the styling for the post archive page, and started working on designs for the single post page.

**Thoughts:** Slow and steady wins the race. You just have to keep trudging along until things get completed.

## Day 017
###### January 24, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ [WordPress Theme Development](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/thejessicafelts_theme)

**Today's Progress:** Today I continued work on my personal site, building out the #100DaysOfCode post archive page, to display a grid of posts (much like how the site displays posts currently), and customizing them for the challenge.

I also started looking into the possible WordPress 5.0 update, where it is rumored that the Gutenberg editor will become the standard. This could have some pretty negative implications for me, being that the majority of my site is built on the ability to heavily customize the admin dashboard with custom post types and custom fields. From what I've ready, there will still be support for plugins like ACF Pro, so it shouldn't bother what I do very much, but it's still something I would like to look into further.

**Thoughts:** Keeping up with news within your industry is a good idea. Up until today, I hadn't heard anything about the Gutenberg editor becoming the standard for WordPress with the next update. I am familiar with the Gutenberg editor (and don't particularly care for it, at all), but I always assumed it was something I would just be able to avoid. I am going to start working on becoming more active in relevant communities, so I'm able to keep up with things like this, when they are first talked about, instead of hearing about them months later...

## Day 016
###### January 23, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ [WordPress Theme Development](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/thejessicafelts_theme)

**Today's Progress:** I have decided to put all of my focus on creating this WordPress theme; so, today, I worked on styling some of the post pages - standard posts, custom post types, archive pages, single post pages, etc. I have decided that getting this site developed, and live is the most important thing for me to be focusing on right now. Without a presentable web presence, none of my other projects will matter. I need a respectable website to drive traffic to, to display my projects on, to tell people out myself with. For the next little while here on my #100DaysofCode logs, it will be nothing but WordPress theme development.

That being said, I do still have a job, and therefore I do still have _private client work_ that I do on a daily basis. However, since I can't really discuss any of that, I'll try not to bring it up as much.

**Thoughts:** I have this problem of sticking to projects. When they are personal projects, don't have a deadline, and my failure to complete them won't have a huge detrimental impact on my life, I have trouble completing them. This is going to be my first project where I sit down and say to myself "yes, there are lots of cool things you could be building - but you need to finish this one first". We'll see how that goes, but having the dedication to stick to one project and see it through is something I greatly want to develop within myself.

## Day 015
###### January 22, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ [WordPress Theme Development](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/thejessicafelts_theme)

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on creating a single post template for this WordPress theme. I included pagination, so readers are able to easily go between posts. I also worked on the main posts page, also including pagination, and adjusting the breakpoints for a better viewing experience across screen sizes.

**Thoughts:** If you're working on a WordPress project, [the Codex Development](https://codex.wordpress.org/) is your best friend.

###### January 21, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ [WordPress Theme Development](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/thejessicafelts_theme)

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on adding archive and single templates for the "onehundreddaysofcode" custom post type. I also updated styles, site-wide.

## Day 013
###### January 20, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ [WordPress Theme Development](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/thejessicafelts_theme)

**Today's Progress:** Today I created the "onehundreddaysofcode" custom post type, to allow for a custom set of posts. I also separated the custom-post-types.php file from the options-pages.php to make sections easier to keep track of.

## Day 012
###### January 19, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Private Client Work
+ WordPress Theme Development

**Today's Progress**: Today includes more of the same as yesterday, which makes daily updates hard. I am continuing to work on tagging and tracking for a private client (I should get feedback today on whether my implementations have been successful), and also working on WordPress Theme development in my down time.

As for what I am planning for the [WordPress Theme](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/thejessicafelts_theme): I am looking to get basic blog functionality roughed out today. I'm not so concerned about styling at this point, since we're still in the very beginning stages of development, but getting it to be functional will do wonders in helping me move forward.

I am also thinking of doing a small side project this weekend. [David](https://github.com/hiplunatic) mentioned yesterday that he had created a textarea input box that only allowed so many characters; when the user had only 100 characters left, the numbers would appear and highlight yellow to let them know they were running out, and then once their character count had gone negative (because apparently this textarea allowed for that), the numbers would be highlighted in red, and the user would no longer be able to submit. I think creating my own version of something like this would be a fun, relatively short side project to work on.

**Thoughts:** It's important to continue learning new things, even when they don't come easy to you. I have always dreaded having to work with tagging for a website, because every client seems to set things up differently, and because of this, it's hard to grasp how/when the tags are being fired. I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn though, because in the long run, it will make me a better developer, and give me an additional skill for my tool belt.

## Day 011
###### January 18, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Private Client Work
+ WordPress Theme Development

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked primary on private client work. This mostly entailed working with content tagging and tracking. Tagging and tracking have never been my strengths, though they are vital to web development, so clients can get a better understanding of their audience, and traffic. I have been struggling the past few days trying to figure out the issues I'm having, but I am very thankful for the opportunity to learn.

Once I was done for the day, I switched my focus to working on development of [the WordPress theme](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/thejessicafelts_theme) I plan to eventually use for [my website](http://www.thejessicafelts.com). I made small bits of progress, and have determined that I _do not_ in fact need an external plugin to control custom post types _(a practice I have been using for the better part of the last year, on the recommendation of a former employer)_.

**Thoughts:** Not really a development-related thought, but: don't accidentally kick rough 1" x 3" boards of wood. I ran my foot into one last night, and now have three or four tiny wooden splinters in my foot, that refuse to come out. Avoiding accidents like this prevent the distraction from your work that is foot pain.

## Day 010
###### January 17, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Private Client Work
+ [Slide Out Navigation (Desktop Only)](https://codepen.io/thejessicafelts/project/details/ABNVpk)

**Today's Progress**: Today, I revised the code for the slide out navigation, and updated the project on GitHub. Aside from these changes, today was filled with around 6 hours of private client work.

**Thoughts:** No thoughts for today. :-)

## Day 009
###### January 16, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Private Client Work
+ WordPress Theme Development

**Today's Progress**: Today, I worked most of the day on projects for a private client. I was able to update our project, debug issues, and meet our tight deadline this afternoon. As for personal projects, I'm going to be working the rest of this afternoon on WordPress theme development. [My Blog](http://www.thejessicafelts) has been distressing me. While, the Twenty Sixteen theme is a great place to start, I just can't use it forever. I've transitioned to Cambium by BestBlogThemes.com for the meantime, and it's made me a little less crazy.

For the WordPress theme, my greatest hope is that I can get something developed, and live by the end of the month. I am not going to release until it's up to par with what I want, but since it's not an overly complicated project, I'm thinking I should be able to get it done quickly.

Last night, I released a CodePen pen for my Slide Out Navigation (Desktop Only), [you can view that here](https://codepen.io/thejessicafelts/project/details/ABNVpk).

**Thoughts:** CodePen. Aside from apparently one small project I published while at a previous job, I haven't really used CodePen. I'm seeing now that it's a great place to showcase live projects. I will definitely be leveraging this in the future.

## Day 008
###### January 15, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ [Slide Out Navigation](https://codepen.io/thejessicafelts/project/details/ABNVpk)

**Today's Progress**: This afternoon, I was able to sit down and work on the sub-menu functionality for the Slide Out Navigation. After attempting to work this out with JavaScript, it hit me that this could be done much easier by using hover states and CSS. After tinkering with that for a few minutes, I had it working.

Tomorrow, when I have a little more time, I'll probably start working on transitions, and having the sub-menus slide in/out smoothly, as opposed to just appearing/disappearing as they are now.

**Thoughts:** You don't always have to overcomplicate things. I was trying to work this functionality out with JavaScript, when in reality, the better way to approach it was with CSS. Work smarter, not harder!

## Day 007
###### January 14, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ [Slide Out Navigation](https://codepen.io/thejessicafelts/project/details/ABNVpk)

**Today's Progress**: Today has been a trying day. [David](https://github.com/hiplunatic) has been ill all day, so I knew there wasn't going to be a lot of progress made on the development front. This evening, I was able to sit down and work on a small project - a slide-out navigation system for a static website.

**Thoughts:** I find small projects, like the one I took on this evening to be very therapeutic in nature. I'm one of those weird people who happen to like coding as a hobby (something I've found to be much less common in my adult life, than it was when I was in middle- and high-school). Being able to sit down and work on something like this gives my brain enough of a workout that I have been feeling accomplished with the progress I've made, but it has been laid back enough to allow me to get my mind off of David being sick.

## Day 006
###### January 13, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Private Client Work
+ [Github Pages](http://thejessicafelts.github.io) "Version 2.0" Development

**Today's Progress**: Aside from a README.md commit to the 100 Days of Code README.md file, there was nothing committed today. It was a day filled with private client work, and general errand running (it _is_ a Saturday, after all). Behind the scenes, I continued to research techniques for the filtering system I want to implement for my GitHub Pages site, and also took notes of some other projects I might like to tackle in the near future.

**Thoughts:** While I am still committed to making sure I publish at least one commit per day, I have to realize that I'm not always going to make substantial progress on my projects on a daily basis, enough to warrant multiple, substantail commits. I have to become okay with this.

## Day 005
###### January 12, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ [Github Pages](http://thejessicafelts.github.io) "Version 2.0" Development
+ Creating a list of [Potential Projects](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/potentialprojectlist/blob/master/redesign-redevelop/list.md)

**Today's Progress**: Today has been a very lazy day. I haven't been feeling well, and staring at a computer screen is one of the last things I wanted to do. However, I did manage to get a few things accomplished: I have began looking into, and experimenting with, alternatives for my Filtering issue on my GitHub Pages site. I've also watched some videos on Machine Learning and Neural Networks - something I'd like to learn more about this year. Additionally, I've created a list of [Potential Projects](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/potentialprojectlist/blob/master/redesign-redevelop/list.md), specifically of websites I'd like to Redesign and Redevelop for practice, this year.

**Thoughts:** Pushing yourself to complete things like this - or any sort of daily challenge - can be hard when you don't feel well. But having the commitment to stick to it is something that I think I'll thank myself for in the long run.

## Day 004
###### January 11, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ [Github Pages](http://thejessicafelts.github.io) "Version 2.0" Development

**Today's Progress**: Today, I'm continuing work on the Filtering feature of my new Projects page, on my GitHub Pages site. Yesterday, I was able to get the filtering working, so that no matter what selections were made (there are three filtering categories, with two to four options each), the appropriate boxes would highlight. The problem is this is that there was a lot of repetitive code, and I _know_ there has to be a better, cleaner, shorter way to accomplish this. Today, I will continue working to refactor this code, and see how far I can get within the day. So far, I'm going through and rewriting parts of the JavaScript that I believe may be a little sloppy - afterwards, I'll work on how I identify each of the projects, and see if I can slim that part down some as well.

**Thoughts:** This is one of the more difficult projects I've taken on in recent memory. Filtering is something I've always wanted to have a grasp on, but not something I ever sat myself down and learned. I have no idea if this is the "correct" way to go about doing it, but I'm getting it to work for me, regardless.

## Day 003
###### January 10, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Professional Work from a Long-Term Contract Client
+ [Github Pages](http://thejessicafelts.github.io) "Version 2.0" Development
+ WordPress Theme Development

**Today's Progress**: Aside from "work" work, and dabbling with WordPress theme development, like I've been doing daily, today I'm also going to be working on updating my GitHub Pages website. I use my GitHub Pages site as a portfolio of sorts, where I can keep a gallery, or list, of projects, with links and demos for people to view. Currently, the site is nothing more than an incomplete list of some projects I've taken on. I also include a biography, and a contact link. Nothing spectacular. Now, I've had to resort to using this site as a main portfolio for myself, as I had taken down my main website - assuming I'd relaunch it much sooner than has happened. So, while I'm still working on relaunching that site, I decided a good use of my Personal Development time would be to redesign how the GitHub Pages site looks and feels, make it more professional, and just make it more complete.

Today, I'm going to be working on playing around with showing and hiding divs with javascript. Just writing that out feels weird, because this is something I have known how to do for a long time, but for my GitHub Pages site, I would like to be able to assign different data-* attributes to each project I feature, and then be able to show or hide projects based on if the user selects to see them. Basically, I want to be able to filter projects by project type, year, or completion. The only way I can think to do this (that will be accepted by GitHub Pages) is with JavaScript, so today I'm going to play around, and see if I can get that to work.

**Thoughts:** Over the last two days, I've had to really think about how I want to develop this GitHub Pages site, to allow for the filtering that I want the site to have. I have considered using classes for each of the project divs, but I think that I can accomplish the same effect by using data-* attributes - something I have very little experience in using. GitHub Pages is a great service, and anyone who has a GitHub account, should definitely put together a GitHub Pages site with a list of projects - but working around its limitations has proven challenging for me (again, in respect to my wanting to filter things). It's challenging in a good way though, and I'm hoping to work through it, with a good outcome.

## Day 002
###### January 09, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Professional Work from a Long-Term Contract Client
+ WordPress Theme Development

**Today's Progress**: There isn't a lot I can talk about with my work today. The bulk of my development today will be billable work for a long-term contract client, with the remainder being work on the WordPress theme (and possibly a plugin?) for [my website](http://www.thejessicafelts.com). Obviously I'm still using the Twenty Sixteen theme from WordPress. That will be changing soon.

I'm also going to be working on a separate WordPress project as well, if time allows. Again, another project I can't really talk much about, but something I hope to share more broadly sooner than later.

**Thoughts:** It can be really hard to find inspiration for projects, when you don't have a lot of time to sit down and look around for it. I always thought I was a decent designer - and when it comes to designing for other people, I am; but when it comes to designing for myself, I am just at a loss. What do I want? What do I need? I would make a horrible client. My main thought for today is that it's hard to start developing something, without any idea what you want the end result to look like. #TheStruggleIsReal

## Day 001
###### January 08, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Markdown (.md) files; specifically in relation to their use on GitHub
+ WordPress Theme Development

**Today's Progress**: I have been working on getting this log setup for a good chunk of this morning. I may fork [Adam Pritchard's Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) so that I can use it for future reference. I have always had trouble remembering the finer points of markdown formatting. _**Goal:** A goal this year is to become better aquatinted with markdown, and to be able to write it more confidently._

After finishing this log, I will begin working on the first stages of development for a new WordPress theme. I relaunched [my blog](http://www.thejessicafelts.com) last night, and while the default _Twenty Sixteen_ theme is nice for starting out, my inner developer needs something fully custom, to be truly happy.

**Thoughts:** I really think I have under estimated the importance of keeping a log like this for the #100DaysOfCode challenge. As I've stated in the main [README.md](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/100-days-of-code/blob/master/README.md) file for this repo, I already tend to spend what this challenge would consider an _adequate_ amount of time coding every day, but to sit down and reflect in a log like this could prove to be very helpful and insightful.

**Link to work:** None available at this time.
