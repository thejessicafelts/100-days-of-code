### 100 Days of Code | Round One
**Started:** January 08, 2018
**Completed:**

## 001
###### January 08, 2018

**Today's Focus Areas:**
+ Markdown (.md) files; specifically in relation to their use on GitHub
+ WordPress Theme Development

**Today's Progress**: I have been working on getting this log setup for a good chunk of this morning. I may fork [Adam Pritchard's Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) so that I can use it for future reference. I have always had trouble remembering the finer points of markdown formatting. _**Goal:** A goal this year is to become better aquatinted with markdown, and to be able to write it more confidently._

After finishing this log, I will begin working on the first stages of development for a new WordPress theme. I relaunched [my blog](http://www.thejessicafelts.com) last night, and while the default _Twenty Sixteen_ theme is nice for starting out, my inner developer needs something fully custom, to be truly happy.

**Thoughts:** I really think I have under estimated the importance of keeping a log like this for the #100DaysOfCode challenge. As I've stated in the main [README.md](https://github.com/thejessicafelts/100-days-of-code/blob/master/README.md) file for this repo, I already tend to spend what this challenge would consider an _adequate_ amount of time coding every day, but to sit down and reflect in a log like this could prove to be very helpful and insightful.

**Link to work:** None available at this time.
